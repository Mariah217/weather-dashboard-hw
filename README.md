Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Weather Dashboard allows you to search any city in the United States and pull the weather from the current day as well as the 5 day forecast. Once you search a city, it saves it to a quick select button under search for easy access. If you want to check the weather in a city that was previously searched, all you have to do is click one of the quick select buttons which stores the five most recent searched cities.

During this project, I learned how to fetch API's and how to pull the specific data that I need to use it for my webiste. I was able to practice creating functions, local storage, if statements and for loops.
